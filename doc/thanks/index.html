<h3 id="generaluser-gs">GeneralUser GS</h3>
<p><a href="https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php">GeneralUser GS 2.0.2</a> by S. Christian Collins is amazingly compact GS/GM SoundFont. It punches way about its weight in kilobyes. Please go and support their work, or <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/schristiancollins">buy them a coffee here</a>.</p>
<p>The app comes bundles with an OGG-compressed version of the SoundFont to keep the size of the app relatively small. The compressed version was made using MuseScore's amazing <a href="https://github.com/musescore/sftools">sftools</a>.</p>
<p>Im am including the license that comes with the SoundFont here for completeness.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">*** GeneralUser GS v2.0.1 ***
***      License v2.0     ***

** License of the complete work **
You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation,
private or commercial. This SoundFont bank is provided to the community free of
charge. Please feel free to use it in your software projects, and to modify the
SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs.

** License of contained samples **
GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within, all of
which allow full use in music production, including the ability to make profit
from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS.

Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks freely
(and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont websites. Because
GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for
publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although
I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages
or sample CDs. Regardless, many &quot;free&quot; SoundFonts available on the web may
indeed contain samples of questionable origin. My understanding of the
copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the
original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in
GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them.

This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a
commercial software product. That being said, I have never received any
complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser
GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies
creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS.

** More info **
If you plan to feature GeneralUser GS on your own website, please do not link
directly to my download files. Either link to my website, or provide your own
local copy instead.

I hope you enjoy GeneralUser GS! This SoundFont bank is the product of many
years of hard work.

You can find updates to GeneralUser GS and more of my virtual instruments at:

Thank you!

<h3 id="freeverb">Freeverb</h3>
<p>Freeverb is public domain reverb implementation from the early 2000s. Developed by "Jezar at Dreampoint", it is a great, easy to use, reverb implementation.</p>
<p>I do not think it has an official website anymore, this <a href="https://github.com/sinshu/freeverb">repo</a> hosts a copy of it. </p>
<p>Here is a snipped of the original license, which can be read on the repo linked above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Feel free to use the source code for Freeverb in any of your own products, whether they are also available for free, or even if they are commercial - I really don't mind. You may do with the code whatever you wish.

<h2 id="other-projects">Other Projects</h2>
<p>I want to acknowledge some other projects that, while not providing code or libraries directly, were either inspirations or useful tools during development.</p>
<h3 id="meltysynth">MeltySynth</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sinshu/meltysynth">MeltySynth</a> was the original code I first looked at when trying to implement SoundFont support years ago. While the app does not use any of its code, I do want to acknowledge and draw attention to this great little project as it was a huge inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="polyphone">Polyphone</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.polyphone.io/">Polyphone</a> is the de-facto tool for SoundFont editing. I used it as a benchmark to compared against during development. Not only is it a great tool, but the website as a ever growing collection of user-generated SoundFonts, which makes it a great resource for KiraStudio as well.</p>
<h3 id="famistudio">FamiStudio</h3>
<p>While KiraStudio is closed source at the moment, the code is an evolution of my other open-source project, <a href="http://famistudio.org">FamiStudio</a>. If you are curious how a slightly more primitive version of the app was put together, go check it out.</p>
<h2 id="demo-songs">Demo Songs</h2>
<p>The app comes with a few demo songs. Most of them are covers, please go support both the original composers and the cover artists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Celeste - First Steps (by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LenaRaine">Lena Raine</a>, cover by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@How2Bboss">How2Bboss</a>, only first few bars for tutorial)</li>
<li>Deltarune - Ruder Buster (by <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox">Toby Fox</a>, cover by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@How2Bboss">How2Bboss</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@How2Bboss">How2Bboss</a> - Cold Brew (original)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zeta Force - Zeta Force (by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zabutom">Zabutom</a>, cover by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@How2Bboss">How2Bboss</a>)</li>
<li>Theme of Mega Man - Battle Network 6 (by Yoshino Aoki, cover by Omega Zero)</li>
