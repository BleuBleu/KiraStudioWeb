Automation tracks are special tracks that control the value of a single parameter, typically a pameter belonging to an instrument or effect of the parent channel, over the course of a song. To learn how to create an automation track for a given parameter, please refer to this section . The automation track editor is made of a few components: On the left is the Scale which shows the horizontal grid values On the top is the Timeline which display the beats in a Bar.Beat format and the pattern names/colors. In the middle is the editor itself where curves are edited. In the top-right corner is the Floating Toolbar which contains various snapping and view options. Editing automation curves This next section will focus on curve editing. Curves are either smooth (interpolated) or not. Uninterpolated curves will switch values abruptly which may be desirable for some types of parameters. As of version 1.0, there is no way to mix smooth and non-smooth segments. As seen in the image above, vertices belonging to the same pattern will be connected by a solid line, while vertices between different patterns wont show a line. This is simply a visual cue to help you differenciate the lines you have intentionally drawn, and the ones the app is implicitely adding between patterns. Adding & deleting vertices Adding vertices is done with a single click. On desktop, you can keep holding the mouse button to fine tune its position until you release. Deleting a single vertex can be done by double-clicking. To deleting the entire selection simply press DEL on desktop, or use the Delete (X) button on the toolbar on mobile. Selecting vertices Selected vertices appear white and can be modified as a group. On desktop, you can select vertices by right-clicking in the background and dragging to draw a rectangle. On mobile, you can long-press in the background and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select a time range of vertices by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar/beat numbers at the top. This is very similar to how selection works in the piano roll . Moving vertices To move vertices simple click and drag. When starting a drag from a selected vertex, all the selected vertices will together. Desktop can also move vertices using the arrow keys. Pressing up/down will move them by 1 major grid increment. Pressing left/right will move by the amount of the currently selected snapping precision. Duplicating vertices (desktop only) While dragging vertices, you can duplicate the current selection by pressing and holding Ctrl . Copy & pasting vertices This works exactly as in the piano roll . Snapping to beats This works exactly as in the piano roll . Changing the zoom level This works exactly as in the piano roll , the only difference being that to zoom vertically, you need to mouse wheel (or pinch using trackpad controls) on the left side scale.","title":"Editing Automation Tracks"},{"location":"autotrack/#overview","text":"The Automation Track Editor is where you edit vertices of automation tracks.

Curves are best suited to automate short or repetitive variations such as the attack of an instrument, or a simple tremolo/vibrato. There are 3 main types of curves in KiraStudio: ADSR Envelope : ADSR refer to Attack, Decay, Sustain & Release. These types of envelopes are very standard in synthetiser and go through a set of well defined phases. They are well suited to shape how the amplitude of a sound changes gradually over time, but may also be used to affect other things such the frequency of a filter during the attack of a note, for example. Custom Curve : Custom curves in KiraStudio can reproduce most of that ADSR envelopes do, but are much more flexible. They can have arbitrary number of vertices, segments can have different curvatures, and custom loop and release points can be set. They are also able to sync to the beat of the song better than ADSR. You may use custom curves as a substitude for ADSR envelopes, but they are generally better suited for things like tremolos and vibratos. When used that way, they are often referred to as LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) in other music applications. Sequence : Sequences are discrete series of numbers, represented as a bar graph. They mostly exist to give more granual control over the values when running at low update rates and trying to reproduce the behavior of retro consoles (e.g. sound like a console that ran at 60Hz). For this reason, the speed at which they they advance is intimately tied to the update rate of your project. Not every parameter will offer you all 3 types of curves, it will try to offer you a selection that makes sense for the type of parameter. Common All 3 curve editors are quite similar. This section will try explain features that are common to more than one editor, and the next sections will look into the features that are more unique to each. All editor features the same components: On the left side is the Scale . It shows the range of possible values and the major/minor grid. On the top is the Timeline which displays the time in various units (seconds, beats, etc.), depending on the context. On the right is the Floating toolbar and contains various parameters related to the curve being edited. In the center is the Viewport and is the main editing area. Adjusting the zoom level Like any most views in the app: On Desktop, you can zoom in and out horizontally by using the mouse wheel. To zoom vertically, you do the same, but on the left-size scale. On Mobile, you can simply pinch to zoom. Presets All envelope editors feature various presets, which can be set and adjusted in the floating toolbar on the right. The ADSR presets are loosely based on this video . This is a great resource to understand how ADSR works and how real instruments behave. For custom curves and sequences, these presets can be adjusted to a min/max range. For example, to create a simple vibrato, choose the sine present and adjust to the desired range. Snapping All editors supports snapping to parameter values (Y-axis), the custom curve editor also supports snapping in the time direction (X-axis) with a configurable grid. Snapping is toggle from the floating toolbar. Loop and release points Curve curves and sequences allow you to place a loop and release point. The Release point is where the playhead will jump to when the note is released. If no loop point is present, the playhead will stop at the release point and maintain that value until the note is released. The Loop point is where the playhead will jump to when it hits either the release point if one if present, or the end of the curve if no release points are present. Sync/Trigger modes Curve curves and sequences can run in 2 modes : Sync or Trigger . Trigger : The curve starts from the beginning when a new note attack is triggered. This mode can only be used on generator parameters. Sync : The curve starts from the beginning of the song and repeats indefinately. This mode will come with limitations. You will not be able to set custom loop/release points or delays. Sync curves are assumed to be constantly looping from the beginning. For parameters that are not on a generator (e.g. on an effect or a channel), the app will force you to use Sync mode, since there is no notion of note being triggered in this context. Copy & pasting Copy and pasting support varies a bit depending the type of curve: For ADSR envelopes and custom curves, you can only copy and paste the entire curve at once. As of version 1.0, there is not selection in these editors. For sequences, there is proper selection and copy/paste support, but unlike other views, pasting will happen at the first selected value. ADSR Envelope Editor The ADSR envelope editor is very straightforward. You can either change the values in milliseconds/seconds in the floating toolbar, or move the vertices in the viewport. The curvature of individual segments can only be changed in the viewport. The curve is always made of 5 vertices, but very often the attack and hold vertices are on top of each other and edited as one, when the hold time is zero. We have been refering to this type of curve as ADSR envelope, but it is technically a AHDSR envelope, where H stands for Hold. Please note that the curve is a only visual representation. The actual amplitude that will be played depends on various factors, such as the amplitude reached at the moment the note was released. Previewing notes using the pop-up piano or a MIDI keyboard will show you the true behavior of the envelope. Custom curve editor The custom curve editor work similarly to the ADSR envelope editor, but is much more sophisticated. Adding/deleting vertices To add new vertices, simply click in an empty space, away from any existing vertex. Deleting vertices is done by double-clicking. Paint Mode Paint-Mode can be activated from the floating toolbar. It can be a quick way to draw very complex curves. Select a shape to paint and draw in the viewport. The painting will be aligned to the X-axis grid. For shapes with varying values (saw, triangle, etc) a Base Value can be specify and be the the minimum value of the painting, the maximum one being where your cursor will draw. The Step preset is particularly useful to create curves changing in discrete steps. Scale release The Scale Release option will be available when using a custom curve for volume-like parameters. This setting will affect the behavior of the release to make it work more like a typical ADSR envelope. More specifically, it will rescale the release part of your curve, at run-time, depending of the value at the time the note was released. For example, if the note was released while the curve had a value of 50%, the entire release will be rescale to make it start from 50%. This prevents audio popping that would be caused by a sudden amplitude change and sound much more natural. Sequence Editor The sequence editor is mostly aimed at retro video game music where values would often change in dicrete steps, at very specific internal, such at once per frame, at 60 FPS. Each step on the X-axis represents the value for 1 Frame . The duration of a frame is derived from the Advance Rate and the Project Update Rate . The advance rate is the number of the interval of the project update rate. For example: If your project update rate is 1500 Hz (the default) and the advance rate is 25, each column represent 1/60th of a second (25 / 1500). If your project update rate is 60 Hz (good for retro video game music) and the advance rate is 1, each column also represents 1/60th of a second (1 / 60). Drawing values Drawing is slightly different on desktop and mobile. On desktop, click and mouse the mouse in the viewport to draw. On mobile, long-press in the viewport, wait for the pulsating circle, then start drawing. Selecting values To select: On desktop, right-click and mouse the mouse in the viewport or the timeline. On mobile, selection is done by long-pressing in the timeline, waiting for the pulsating circle, then making the selection. Changing values Once you have a selection, values can be editing as a group. The Scale Mode can also be changed in the floating toolbar to switch between Absolute and Relative scaling, the former simply offsetting values and the latter trying to preserve the shape of the selection. Advanced topics Dynamics Depending on the type of curve and parameter being automated, the Dynamics section of the floating toolbar may contain some graphs allowing to affect the scale (i.e. intensity) or rate (i.e. speed) at which a curve is played. For example, the ADSR envelopes on the \"Envelope\" parameter of most generator will show the 4 graphs: Velocity (X) vs. Scale (Y) : How the velocity note parameter in the piano roll affects the scale/intensity of the curve. By default, there is a 1:1 relationship so the velocity essentially acts like a volume control. Velocity (X) vs. Rate (Y) : How the velocity note parameter in the piano roll affects the rate/speed of the curve. By default there is no impact on the speed, but this allows playing curves slower/faster depending on the velocity. Key (X) vs. Scale (Y) : How the note being played (e.g. C4) affects the scale/intensity of the curve. By default, this has no effect but can be make to play curve more/less intensively depending on the note. This is sometimes called \"key scale level\". Key (X) vs. Rate (Y) : How the note being played (e.g. C4) affects the rate/speed of the curve. By default, there is no impact on the speed, but can be make to play curve slower/faster depending on the note. This is sometimes called \"key scale rate\". In some other situation, for non-envelope parameters, you will be able to control how the curve responds to Aftertouch . This is particularly useful to create ad-hoc vibrato or tremolo on some specific notes. By controlling the intensity of the curve by the aftertouch, you can selectively change the aftertouch value of some notes and only trigger the vibrato or tremolo at the desired time. Pinning On desktop, in the project explorer , it is possible to pin a curve and see a small editor. This is intended to allow small adjustments of curves without having to open the full fledge editor. To pin a curve, right-click on a parameter automated by a curve and select the pin option. Unpinning is done in a similar way.","title":"Editing ADSR Envelopes, Custom Curves & Sequences"},{"location":"envelopes/#overview","text":"Curves are one way to automate (i.e. control) the value of parameter on a generator, effect or channel.

On mobile, the project explorer is not always visible and slides from the right side on demand by pressing the Project button from the toolbar. A much quicker way to open it and navigate directly to a channel is to double-tap on a channel's name in the sequencer . The project explorer displays parameters in sections that can be expanded and collapsed. Some sections will be collapsed by default and will need to be expanded to reveal the parameters, especially on mobile where vertical space is limited. Project structure At the very top of the project explorer is the Navigation bar . Much like a folder hierarchy on a computer, it shows the path of the current object in your project. In the example below, the \"Bitcrushed Drum 1\" channel is contained in the \"Ruder Buster\" song, which is itself part of the \"Deltarune\" project. Each portion of the path is clickable and will bring you to that specific object. The general structure of a project in KiraStudio is: A project contains one or more song(s) Each song contains a series of channel(s) Each channel (which may any of the 3 types ) may contain effect(s). A project also contains zero or more instrument(s) Each instruments is made of generator(s) A project also contains zero or more samples(s) Editing songs When creating a new project, it will already contain 1 song, but a project may contain multiple. To create a new song, navigate back to the root of your project and click the (+) Add Song button. Clicking on a song will show its properties and will make it the active one inside the app. Song have very few parameters. Besides their name and colors, which can be customized, they mostly just have a duration (in bars) and a default time signature. The default time signature is the main time signature that will be used in bars without a custom time signature . Also displayed along with the song parameters the the list of channels. Clicking a channel will navigate to its parameters, exactly as if you had click on the channel name in the sequencer . Editing channels Channels are the main type of objects you will be looking at in the project explorer. There are 3 types of channels in KiraStudio, we will explore each one in the next sections. Effect chains Effect chains a simple channels that can contain a series of effects (reverb, filters, etc.). Instrument channels can send their outputs to effect chains, and effects chains can be cascaded and should ultimately end at the Master channel. Please note that unlike traditional DAWs, audio is always sent fully to a single effect chains. As of version 1.0, it is not possible only partially send audio to a chain, or to send to more than one chain. Besides their name/color, effect chains have 3 unique parameters: Volume : Basic volume adjustment. Balance : Stereo balance adjustment. Effect Send : The effect chain to send this channel's audio to. A much more efficient way of adjusting the volume, balance and effect send of a channel is to use the mixer view of the sequencer . Effects are applied one at a time, in a top-to-bottom order, but the channel volume and balance are applied at the end, after all effects of the channel have been applied. To alter the volume or balance prior to, or between 2 effects, a dedicated Volume and Pan/Balance effect exists. Effects can be added by pressing the (+) Add Effect button below the last effect and can be deleted by right-clicking (or long-pressing on mobile) on a specific effect and selecting the delete option. Master channel The master channel is a special type of effect chain. There is always one in a song, it is always the final effect chain and it can never be deleted. Besides the standard effect chain parameters, the master channel as 2 unique parameters: BPM : The main BPM of the song. This value can be automated to create tempo variations. Final DC Removal Frequency (Hz) : There is a very slightly high-pass filter applied on the final output to remove any DC component. Some channels will have their own DC removal feature, but this one is there to avoid clipping when combining asymmetric waveforms. The master channel may also contain effect(s) and it works the exact same way as effect chains. Placing effects on the master channel is actually the most efficient place to put them as this will ensure they are only applied once, keeping the CPU usage low. Instrument channels Instrument channels are the most complex type of channel. They feature all the same parameters as effect chains, but also reference an instrument. Is it important to understand that instrument channels reference (i.e. use) an instrument present in your project. An instrument can be used by multiple channels at once. For convenience, when displaying the parameters of an instrument channel, KiraStudio will also show you the parameters of that instrument in the channel. Channels have their own name/color, independent of the name/color of the instrument For example, in the image below, the channel \"Bitcrushed Drums 1\" channel is purple and uses the instrument \"GS ROOM\", which is yellow. We are effectively looking at 2 objects : an instrument at the top and a channel at the bottom. This order is to emphasis that effects are applied after generating the audio of the instrument. Besides the standard effect chain parameters, instrument channels have a single unique parameter: Instrument : This allow changing the instrument used by the channel. Clicking this will allow choosing a different one, or create a new one from scratch. Editing instruments Instruments in KiraStudio are composed of Generators . A generator is a small unit able to produce an audio signal. They range from very basic oscillators such as sawtooth and square waves, all the way to complex things like SoundFonts. This section will only explain the general principles, a comprehensive generator reference is also provided. Most instruments will only contain a single generator, but combining them can yield interesting effects. In the example below, a lead instrument is created by adding a pulse-modulated square waveform and a sawtooth waveform. Generators are combined in a top-to-bottom order. When adding generators this is not very important, but when using different Blend Modes , this becomes important. Generators can be added by pressing the (+) Add Generator button below the last generator and can be deleted by right-clicking (or long-pressing on mobile) on a specific generator and selecting the delete option. As mentioned in the previous section, instruments can be edited through a channel using the instrument. They can also be edited on their own by navigating to the root of the project and clicking an instrument. Both achieve the same result, the only difference is that some form of automation, namely automation tracks and note parameters can only exist when an instrument is used of a channel. In other words, the same instrument, used by 2 different channels may different parameters automated. This will me covered in the next sections.

Note that the selected channel may not necessarely be the one being edited. On the top is the Timeline which display the beats in a Bar.Beat format and the pattern names/colors. In the middle is the piano roll itself where notes are edited. In the top-right corner is the Floating Toolbar which contains various snapping and view options. At the bottom is the Note Parameter Editor where extra note parameters (velocity, pan, aftertouch, etc.) can be edited. This panel revealed by using the optionon the floating toolbar. Unlike other apps like FL Studio, the piano roll does not only show you the notes of the current pattern in a vacuum, it displays a continuous view of a track. Notes can be freely moved from one pattern to another. Notes can extend far beyond the end of a pattern, but ultimately they belong to the pattern where they start from. Editing Notes We will focus our attention to the center of the piano roll where all the notes lie. Adding & deleting notes To add a new note, simply click on an empty space. On desktop, you can choose between 2 editing modes in the floating toolbar. Both will create a note of the last duration used, they only differ on what happens when you move afterwards, while still holding the mouse button Click & Move : Moving after the initial click will allow you to reposition the note. Click & Resize : Moving after the initial click will allow you to change the duration of the note. On all platforms, deleting single notes is achieve by double-clicking. Shift-Click is also an alternate option on desktop. Selecting notes Selected notes have a white outline around them and can be modified as a group. On desktop, you can select notes by right-clicking in the background and dragging to draw a rectangle. On mobile, you can long-press in the background and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select a time range of notes by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar/beat numbers at the top. Moving, transposing & resizing notes To move notes simple click and drag. When starting a drag from a selected note, all the selected notes will together. On desktop, notes can be resized by grabbing their left or right side edge and dragging. Desktop can also move notes using the arrow keys. Pressing up/down will transpose by 1 semitone or 1 octave if Ctrl is held at the same time. Pressing left/right will move by the amount of the currently selected snapping precision. On mobile, notes are resized by using one of the big colored resize handle. Duplicating notes When there us more than 1 note selected, the entire selection can be duplicated by dragging from the Colored Paperstack Icon and release it where you want to create the copy. On desktop, the same can also be accomplished by pressing and holding Ctrl while dragging notes. Desktop Mobile Copy & pasting notes An alternative way of duplicating notes is to use copy & paste. This provides more flexibility as it allows copy and pasting notes between tracks. Copy notes to the clipboard by making a selection and pressing Ctrl+C , or use the toolbar button. Position the playhead at the desired location Paste the stored notes using Ctrl+V , or use the toolbar button on mobile. Snapping to beats Snapping to beats (i.e. vertical grid) can be toggled from the floating toolbar on the right and the precision can be adjusted. The snapping precision is expressed in beats. This mean that using a 4/4 time signature, for example, snapping to 1/4 Beat snaps to 1/16th notes. Changing the zoom level On desktop, like in most views of the app, zooming horizontally is done using the mouse wheel, or a pinch gesture when using trackpad controls . To zoom in vertically, simply use the mousewheel (or pinch on trackpad) on the vertical piano on the left. On mobile, all zooming is done with a pinch gesture. Slide notes Slide notes are notes that start at a given pitch (the pitch of the note) and slowly change to hit a target pitch which is represented by where the triangle ends. To create a slide note, simple select one of the 3 slide note mode from the contextual menu that appears when right-clicking (long-pressing on mobile) on a note. Alternatively on desktop, holding the S key, clicking on a note and dragging up/down will start the creation of a slide note. There are 3 types of slide notes: Note Linear : This is roughly the equivalent of doing a glissando on a piano. The note value itself (ex: A4 to A5) will be interpolated, leading to a natural sounding slide. Unless you are trying to achieve a specific retro or chiptune effect, use this mode. Frequency Linear : This will interpolate the frequency of the note (ex: 440Hz to 880Hz) and use the result as the final frequency. Period Linear : This will interpolate the period (ex: 1/440Hz to 1/880Hz) and use this as the final frequency. This mode is particularly useful to mimic the behavior of retro/chiptune slides. The frequency and period linear modes will display a convex or concave slide note. Please note that this is simply a rough visual cue and does not accurately represent the pitch of the note that will actually play. The target and duration of a slide note can be modified by dragging the Four-Arrows Icon that will appear if a slide note is present. When using the note end release mode , slide notes can extend beyond the release of the note, as sound can still be heard during the release. When using the manual release mode , slide notes we be required to end exactly at the end of the note, as this represent a hard-kill. When using the Disabling attack By default, notes have an attack which mean they will restart their envelopes from the beginning. The attack can be toggled for a particular note by selecting the Toggle Note Attack option from the contextual menu that appear when right-clicking (long-pressing on mobile). Notes with no attack will show an ellipsis (...) before their value. This can be seen in the image above where is note following a slide note has its attack disabled to create a single, long, gliding note. Disabling the attack in the piano roll does not garantee it will always work. In general, you should try to keep the note without attack in close proximity to the end of another note. Failure to do so may result in the attack still playing. Here is a more technical breakdown of how it all work. When the player encounter a note without attack, it will look for a previous note still producing sound that can be continued by the note without attack. If the note without attack is immediately after the end of an existing note, it will continue it. If the note without attack is shortly after the end of an existing note, while its release is still playing, it will continue it and stay in the release state. If there are multiple candidate notes, it will take the one with the closest matching pitch. This test will consider slides in this calculation (ex: a note without attack being near the end of a slide notes). Arpeggio chords Arpeggio Chords take the notes of a chord and arpeggiate it rapidly in a pre-defined sequence. This option is mostly there to mimic a trick often used in chiptune songs where composers would play notes of a chords in quick succession to make up for the lack of polyphony on old hardware. To enable arpeggio chords, simply select the notes of a chord, right-click on any selected note (long-press on mobile) and select Toggle Selection Arpeggio Chords from the contextual menu. Visually, notes with arpeggio chords enabled will be drawn with a stripe pattern. The speed and order in which individual notes of an arpeggio is played is controlled in the channel settings, under the Arpeggio tab. Release modes Ghost notes Ghost Notes are a visual tool allowing you to see a semi-transparent version of the notes of another channel while editing another. This can be useful to align things to each other. As of version 1.0, the feature is quite primitive. Ghost notes can be enabled for a single channel, or for all channels at once using the option from the floating toolbar. Note Parameters The note parameter editor can be opening using the option in the floating toolbar. This panel allows you to edit additional properties of notes, such as note velocity, stereo panning, etc. This editor only shows one parameter at a given time and you can chose which one by using the option in the floating toolbar. Editing note parameters Editing note parameters is quite simple, simply click and drag to paint values. If notes are currently selected, only the selected notes can be edited. Snapping You can snap the painted values to the major grid by enabling the Parameter Values option in the Snap section of the floating toolbar. Changing the zoom level On desktop, you can zoom vertically and get more precision when editing note parameters by simply use the mousewheel (or pinch on trackpad) on the scale on the left side of the parameter editor. Note parameter curves Some parameters, such as Velocity, only support a single constant values for each note. Other types of parameter may support having their parameter value change during the playback of a note. The type of value for a given note parameter can be changed through the Value Type option of the floating toolbar while one or more notes are selected. If the option is greyed out, it means this parameter does not support curves. Constant : a single value that remains constant. Curve : a value that can change abrutly. Curve (Interpolated) : a value that changes smoothly Once a note is set to either curve modes, you can edit its curve by enabling the Curve Edit Mode from the floating toolbar. As of version 1.0, this feature is quite primitive and can only be enabled when a single note is selected. When curve edit mode is active, a single-click on the curve will add a new vertex, and double-click with delete and existing one. The first and last vertex cannot be deleted and the last vertex is currently required to be at the end of the note duration. Vertices can be moved by dragging and will respect any snapping setting.","title":"Editing Notes in the Piano Roll"},{"location":"pianoroll/#overview","text":"The Piano Roll is where you enter notes inside of patterns and likely where you will be spending most of your time in the app. The piano roll is made of a few components: On the left is the Vertical Piano which can be used to preview the instrument of the selected channel.

Alternatively on desktop, holding the S key, clicking on a note and dragging up/down will start the creation of a slide note. There are 3 types of slide notes: Note Linear : This is roughly the equivalent of doing a glissando on a piano. The note value itself (ex: A4 to A5) will be interpolated, leading to a natural sounding slide. Unless you are trying to achieve a specific retro or chiptune effect, use this mode. Frequency Linear : This will interpolate the frequency of the note (ex: 440Hz to 880Hz) and use the result as the final frequency. Period Linear : This will interpolate the period (ex: 1/440Hz to 1/880Hz) and use this as the final frequency. This mode is particularly useful to mimic the behavior of retro/chiptune slides. The frequency and period linear modes will display a convex or concave slide note. Please note that this is simply a rough visual cue and does not accurately represent the pitch of the note that will actually play. The target and duration of a slide note can be modified by dragging the Four-Arrows Icon that will appear if a slide note is present. When using the note end release mode , slide notes can extend beyond the release of the note, as sound can still be heard during the release.

This can be seen in the image above where is note following a slide note has its attack disabled to create a single, long, gliding note. Disabling the attack in the piano roll does not garantee it will always work. In general, you should try to keep the note without attack in close proximity to the end of another note. Failure to do so may result in the attack still playing. Here is a more technical breakdown of how it all work. When the player encounter a note without attack, it will look for a previous note still producing sound that can be continued by the note without attack. If the note without attack is immediately after the end of an existing note, it will continue it. If the note without attack is shortly after the end of an existing note, while its release is still playing, it will continue it and stay in the release state.

The sequencer is made of a few components: On the left side is the channel & track list. At the top is the timeline where each bar is numbered. In the middle is the grid of patterns In the top-right corner is the floating toolbar containing a few view options Each column of the sequencer represents exactly 1 Bar of music, and each row represent a Track . A track is always part of a Channel and will display the color of its parent channel. A channel may have zero or more tracks. Visually all tracks of a channel are the same color and the first track of a channel will have a little icon next to its names, allowing you to mute/solo it. Please note that the terms channels and tracks do not correspond to the concept of MIDI channels or tracks. This app is not concerned with MIDI beyond import or export. There are 2 types of tracks: Piano Roll tracks contain musical notes. Automation tracks contain curves that can modify the value of a single parameter over the course of the song There are 3 types of channel: Instrument Channels use an instruments to generate sound. Instrument channel can have either piano roll and automation tracks. Effect Chains only contain effects and can optionally use automation track to modify the values of effect parameters. The Master Channel is always present and cannot be deleted. It is effectively the final effect chain but can do special things such as automate the BPM of the song. Channels & Tracks On the left side of the sequencer are all the channel & tracks of the current song. Selected channel The Selected Channel is displayed with lighter color in the sequencer and is the channel that will be previewed when playing the pop-up piano, or pressing keys on a MIDI controller. To change the selected channel, simply click on an instrument channel. In the above screenshot, the \"Bitcrushed Drums 1\" channel is selected channel. Adding channels & Tracks To add a new channel, simply press the (+) Add button below the last track. You will be prompted with the type of channel to add. Additionally, if there is a selected channel, you'll have the option to add a piano roll track to it. Having multiple piano roll track on a channel is mostly for your own organization, although there are some cases where it is genuinely useful (arpeggios, playing the same note twice, etc.). To add an automation track, you need to choose a parameter to automate in the project explorer Deleting channels & tracks To delete a track or a channel, simply right-click on its name or long press on mobile. A contextual menu will give you the option to delete. Muting & Soloing channels Muting a channel is done by clicking on its icon. Visually, muted channels have their icon dimmed. A single click will mute a channel, while a double click will solo it by muting all the other channels. Changing channel parameters When clicking on any track of channel, the project explorer will navigate to that channel, allowing you to edit its properties. On mobile, double tapping on a channel name will also pop open the project explorer from the right on the screen. These parameters are explained more in depth in the project explorer section of the documentation, but this is where you can change the name, color, volume, balance and effect send of a specific channel. Individual tracks cannot be renamed. Mixer view A much more efficient way to change the volume, balance and send effect chain of a channel is simply to open the Mixer View . This is done by checking the option from View section of the floating toolbar on the top right of the sequencer. Reordering channels & tracks On the right of the mixer view are the Reordering Grips which allow reordering channel & tracks. To reorder a channel (i.e. move all the tracks a channel relative to other channels), grab the first track of the channel and you will be able to move the entire channel up or down relative to others. To reorder a track inside a channel, grab any track that is not the first one, and you will be able to moving it relative to other tracks inside that channel. Please do note that piano roll tracks always come before automation tracks in a channel and this will be enforced during reordering. Patterns & Bars At the center of the sequencer are all the patterns of the current song. Patterns are re-usable little units of notes or automation that you can re-use multiple times on a given track. They can be as small as 1 bar, but can be much longer too. Difference with other DAWs Before we start, please note that patterns, sometimes called clips in other apps, are edited slightly differently from mainstream DAWs. In some DAWs (e.g. FL Studio Mobile), resizing a pattern makes it loop multiple times. In KiraStudio, resizing a pattern simply changes its duration, repetition is done using Instancing which creates a linked copy of a pattern. Another difference is that, when opening in the piano roll or automation editor, patterns are shown with the rest of the song. In other DAWs, clips are editing in a vacuum, without seeing the outside context. In KiraStudio, the piano roll or automation editor are basically an extreme close up on a track. Please do keep these differences in mind as you read the next few sections. Adding, Deleting & Resizing patterns Patterns are simply added by clicking in an empty space in the grid. On desktop, patterns are deleted using a double-click and they are resized by grabbing the left or right edge and resizing. On mobile a double-tap opens the pattern in the appropriate editor, either the piano roll or automation track editor. To any selected pattern(s) on mobile, you can simply press the Delete button from the toolbar (big X icon), or use the contextual menu that appears when long-pressing a pattern. To help resizing on small screens, the mobile version will display big colored resize handles for the selected pattern(s), allowing you to resize it from the left or right side. Selecting patterns Selected patterns have a white outline around them and can be moved and resized as a group. On desktop, you can select patterns by right-clicking anywhere in the grid and dragging to drag a rectangle. On mobile, you can long-press somewhere and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select entire columns of patterns by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar numbers at the top. When selecting patterns this way, you will notice that the bar numbers also get a white outline around them. This is important and means that if you copy these patterns, or move them left/right, the associated custom time signatures will also be moved with them. Without the bar highlight, only the patterns are move and no tempo information is. Desktop Mobile Copying & instancing patterns Patterns have an associated 3-digit numbers. This number is a unique pattern on a given track and allows you to tell if a pattern is used multiple times inside a track. Re-using a pattern multiple times in a track is called instancing . When modifying a pattern, all of the its instances will be modified at the same time. Another way to tell if a pattern is an instance of another is simply to select it and to look for the chain link icon . When a pattern is selected, all of its instances will show this icon and the 3-digit numbers will appear white. In the example below, pattern 000 is selected and a few other instance are shown. To create an instance of an existing pattern, simply selected it and drag from the little Colored Chain-Link Button that appears at the bottom left and release where you want to create the instance. Note that trying to create an instance on a different track will force a copy. To create a completely separate copy of a pattern, a copy that will retain no connection to the original, simply drag from the Colored Paperstack Icon that appears and release it where you want to create the copy. Desktop Mobile De-instancing patterns If you have created instances of a pattern, but have second thoughts and want to make a unique copy, you can simply right-click on a pattern (long-press on mobile) and select the Make Pattern(s) Unique option. This will create a completely independent copy of it which its own unique 3-digit number. Merging identical patterns On the flip side, if you have created many copies of a pattern and did not end up making any unique changes to them, you can select a few patterns, right click (long-press on mobile) on the selected pattern(s) and choose the Merge Identical Patterns option. This will look for perfectly identical pattern and create instances if matches are found. Setting the loop point Each song can have a loop point which is where the song will jump to when the end is reached. Currently this is quite primitive and the song will loop forever. To set the loop point to a specific bar, simply right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number in the timeline and choose the Set Loop Point option. To clear the loop point and create a non-looping song, right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number of the currently set loop point and choose the Clear Loop Point option. Custom time signatures Songs have a default time signature, which is usually the time signature that covers most of the song. But for each bar of the song, a Custom Time Signature can be specified. To set a custom time signature for a given bar, right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number and select the Edit Custom Time Signature... option. If multiple bars are selected using the timeline selection mode, the changes will be applied to all selected bars.","title":"Editing Channels, Tracks & Patterns"},{"location":"sequencer/#overview","text":"The Sequencer (or Pattern Editor) displays a grid of patterns and it is where you will edit the high level structure of your song.

GeneralUser GS GeneralUser GS 2.0.2 by S. Christian Collins is amazingly compact GS/GM SoundFont. It punches way about its weight in kilobyes. Please go and support their work, or buy them a coffee here . The app comes bundles with an OGG-compressed version of the SoundFont to keep the size of the app relatively small. The compressed version was made using MuseScore's amazing sftools . Im am including the license that comes with the SoundFont here for completeness. *** GeneralUser GS v2.0.1 *** *** License v2.0 *** ** License of the complete work ** You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation, private or commercial. This SoundFont bank is provided to the community free of charge. Please feel free to use it in your software projects, and to modify the SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs. ** License of contained samples ** GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within, all of which allow full use in music production, including the ability to make profit from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS. Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks freely (and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont websites. Because GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages or sample CDs. Regardless, many \"free\" SoundFonts available on the web may indeed contain samples of questionable origin. My understanding of the copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them. This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a commercial software product. That being said, I have never received any complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS. ** More info ** If you plan to feature GeneralUser GS on your own website, please do not link directly to my download files. Either link to my website, or provide your own local copy instead. I hope you enjoy GeneralUser GS! This SoundFont bank is the product of many years of hard work. You can find updates to GeneralUser GS and more of my virtual instruments at: http://www.schristiancollins.com I can be reached via the contact page on my website here: https://www.schristiancollins.com/contact Thank you! -~Chris Freeverb Freeverb is public domain reverb implementation from the early 2000s. Developed by \"Jezar at Dreampoint\", it is a great, easy to use, reverb implementation. I do not think it has an official website anymore, this repo hosts a copy of it. Here is a snipped of the original license, which can be read on the repo linked above. Feel free to use the source code for Freeverb in any of your own products, whether they are also available for free, or even if they are commercial - I really don't mind. You may do with the code whatever you wish. Other Projects I want to acknowledge some other projects that, while not providing code or libraries directly, were either inspirations or useful tools during development. MeltySynth MeltySynth was the original code I first looked at when trying to implement SoundFont support years ago. While the app does not use any of its code, I do want to acknowledge and draw attention to this great little project as it was a huge inspiration. Polyphone Polyphone is the de-facto tool for SoundFont editing. I used it as a benchmark to compared against during development. Not only is it a great tool, but the website as a ever growing collection of user-generated SoundFonts, which makes it a great resource for KiraStudio as well. FamiStudio While KiraStudio is closed source at the moment, the code is an evolution of my other open-source project, FamiStudio . If you are curious how a slightly more primitive version of the app was put together, go check it out. Demo Songs The app comes with a few demo songs. Most of them are covers, please go support both the original composers and the cover artists. Celeste - First Steps (by Lena Raine , cover by How2Bboss , only first few bars for tutorial) Deltarune - Ruder Buster (by Toby Fox , cover by How2Bboss ) How2Bboss - Cold Brew (original) The Legend of Zeta Force - Zeta Force (by Zabutom , cover by How2Bboss ) Theme of Mega Man - Battle Network 6 (by Yoshino Aoki, cover by Omega Zero) Some of these demo songs require external SoundFonts, please visit this page for direct download links.
