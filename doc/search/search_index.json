Note that the selected channel may not necessarely be the one being edited. On the top is the Timeline which display the beats in a Bar.Beat format. In the middle is the piano roll itself where notes are edited. At the bottom is the Note Parameter Editor where extra note parameters (velocity, pan, aftertouch, etc.) can be edited. In the top-right corner is the Floating Toolbar which contains various snapping and view options. Unlike other apps like FL Studio, the piano roll does not only show you the notes of the current pattern in a vacuum, it displays a continuous view of a track. Notes can be freely moved from one pattern to another. Notes can extend beyong the end of a pattern, but they belong to the pattern where they start from. Editing Notes We will focus our attention to the center of the piano roll where all the notes lie. Adding & deleting notes To add a new note, simply click on an empty space. On desktop, you can click and drag to adjust the final position of the note. On mobile, it just a tap. On all platforms, deleting single notes is achieve by double-clicking. Shift-Click is also an alternate option on desktop. Selecting notes Selected notes have a white outline around them and can be modified as a group. On desktop, you can select notes by right-clicking in the background and dragging to drag a rectangle. On mobile, you can longpress in the background and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select a time range of notes by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar/beat numbers at the top. Moving, transposing & resizing notes To move notes simple click and drag. When starting a drag from a selected note, all the selected notes will together. On desktop, notes can be resized by grabbing the left or right side edge and dragging. Desktop can also move notes using the arrow keys. Pressing up/down will transpose by 1 semitone or 1 octave if Ctrl is held at the same time. Pressing left/right will move by the amount of the currently selected snapping precision. On mobile, notes are resized by using one of the big colored resize handle. Duplicating notes When there are more than 1 note selected, the entire selection can be duplicated by dragging from the Colored Paperstack Icon that appears and release it where you want to create the copy. On desktop, the same can also be accomplished by pressing and holding Ctrl while dragging notes. TODO : A mobile/desktop GIF here would be nice. Snapping to beats Snapping to beats can be toggled from the floating toolbar on the right and the precision can be adjusted. The snapping precision is expressed in beats. This mean that in a 4/4 time signature, for example, snapping to 1/4 Beat snaps to 1/16th notes. Slide notes Slide notes are notes that start at a given pitch (the pitch of the note) and slowly change to hit a target pitch which is represented by where the triangle ends. TODO : Image here. To create a slide note, simple select one of the 3 slide note mode from the contextual menu that appears when right-clicking (long-pressing on mobile) on a note. There are 3 types of slide notes: Note Linear : This is roughly the equivalent of doing a glissando on a piano. The note value itself (ex: A4 to A5) will be interpolated, leading to a natural sounding slide. Unless you are trying to achieve a specific retro or chiptune effect, use this mode. Frequency Linear : This will interpolate the frequency of the note (ex: 440Hz to 880Hz) and use the result as the final frequency. Period Linear : This will interpolate the period (ex: 1/440Hz to 1/880Hz) and use this as the final frequency. This mode is particularly useful to mimic the behavior of retro/chiptune slides. The frequency and period linear modes will display a convex or concave slide note. Please note that this is simply a rough visual cue and does not accurately represent the pitch of the note that will actually play. The target and duration of a slide note can be modified by dragging the Four-Arrows Icon that will appear if a slide note is present. When using the note end release mode , slide notes can extend beyond the release of the note, as sound can still be heard during the release. When using the manual release mode , slide notes we be required to end exactly at the end of the note, as this represent a hard-kill. When using the Disabling attack By default, notes have an attack which mean they will restart their envelopes from the beginning. The attack can be toggled for a particular note by selecting the Toggle Note Attack option from the contextual menu that appear when right-clicking (long-pressing on mobile). Notes with no attack will show an ellipsis (...) before their value. TODO : Image here. Disabling the attack in the piano roll does not mean it will always work, there are a few rules to understand on how the audio player uses them. Generally speaking, when the player encounter a note without attack, it will look for a previous note still producing sound that can be continued by the note without attack. If the note without attack is immediately after the end of an existing note, it will continue it. If the note without attack is shortly after the end of an existing note, while its release is still playing, it will continue it. If there are multiple candidate notes that could be continued, it will take the one with the closest matching pitch. This test will consider slides in this calculation (ex: a note without attack being near the end of a slide notes). Arpeggio chords Arpeggio Chords take the notes of a chord and arpeggiate it rapidly in a pre-defined sequence. This option is there to mimic a trick often used in chiptune songs where composers would quickly play notes of a chords to make up for the lack of polyphony on old hardware. To enable arpeggio chords, simply select the notes of a chord, right-click on any selected note (long-press on mobile) and select Toggle Selection Arpeggio Chords from the contextual menu. Visually, notes with arpeggio chords enabled will be drawn with a stripe pattern. TODO : Image here.

The sequencer is made of a few components: On the left side is the channel & track list. At the top is the timeline where each bar is numbered. In the middle is the grid of patterns In the top-right corner is the floating toolbar containing a few view options Each column of the sequencer represents exactly 1 bar of music, and each row represent a Track . A track is always part of a Channel and a channel may have zero or more tracks. Please note that the names channels and tracks do not correspond to the concept of MIDI channels or tracks. This app is not concerned with MIDI beyond import or export. There are 2 types of tracks: Piano Roll tracks contain musical notes. Automation tracks contain curves that can modify the value of a single parameter over the course of the song There are 3 types of channel: Instrument Channels use an instruments to generate sound. Instrument channel can have either piano roll and automation tracks. Effect Chains only contain effects and can only use automation track to automate the value of the effect parameters. The Master Channel is always present and cannot be deleted. It is effectively the final effect chain but can do special things such as automate the BPM of the song. Visually each row is a track and all track of a channel are the same color. Channels have a little icon next to their names. Channels & Tracks On the left side of the sequencer are all the channel & tracks of the current song. Selected channel The Selected Channel is diplayed with lighter color in the sequencer and is the channel that will be previewed when playing the pop-up piano, or pressing keys on a MIDI controller. To change the selected channel, simply click on an instrument channel. In the above screenshot, the \"Bitcrushed Drums 1\" channel is selected channel. Adding channels & Tracks To add a new channel, simply press the (+) Add button below the last track. You will be prompted with the type of channel to add. Additionally, if there is an selected channel, you'll have the option to add a piano roll track to it. Having multiple piano roll track on a channel is mostly for your own organization, althrough there are some cases where it is genuinely useful (arpeggios, playing the same note twice, etc.). To add an automation track, you need to choose a parameter to automate in the project explorer Deleting channels & tracks To delete a track or a channel, simply right-click on its name or long press on mobile. A contextual menu will give you the option to delete. Muting & Soloing channels Muting a channel is done by clicking on its icon. Visually, muted channels have their icon dimmed. A single click will mute a channel, while a double click will solo it but muting all the other channels. Changing channel parameters When clicking on any track of channel, the project explorer will navigate to that channel, allowing you to edit its properties. On mobile, double tapping on a channel name will also pop open the project explorer from the right on the screen. These parameters are explained more in depth in the project explorer section of the documentation, but this is where you can change the name, color, volume, balance and effect send of a specific channel. Individual tracks cannot be renamed. Mixer view A much more efficient way to change the volume, pan and send effect chain of a channel is simply to open the Mixer View . This is done by checking the option from View section of the floating toolbar on the top right of the sequencer. Reordering channels & tracks On the right of the mixer view are the Reordering Grips which allow reordering channel & tracks. To reorder a channel, grab the first track of the channel and you will be able to move the entire channel up or down relative to others. To reorder a track inside a channel, grab any track that is not the first one, and you will be able to moving it relative to other tracks inside that channel. Please do note that piano roll tracks always come before automation tracks in a channel. Patterns & Bars At the center of the sequencer are all the patterns of the current song. Patterns can be as small as 1 bar, but can be much longer too. Patterns are re-usable little units of notes or automation tat you can re-use multiple times on a given track. Adding, Deleting & Resizing patterns Patterns are simply added by clicking in an empty space in the grid. On desktop, patterns are deleted using a double-click and they are resized by grabbing the left or right edge and resizing. On mobile a double-tap opens the pattern in the appropriate editor, either the piano roll or automation track editor. To delete a pattern on mobile, you can simply press the Delete button from the toolbar (big X icon) to delete any selected pattern(s). To help resizing on small screens, the mobile version will display big colored resize handles for the selected pattern(s), allowing you to resize it from the left or right side. Selecting patterns Selected patterns have a white outline around them and can be moved and resized as a group. On desktop, you can select patterns by right-clicking anywhere in the grid and dragging to drag a rectangle. On mobile, you can longpress somewhere and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select entire columns of patterns by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar numbers at the top. When selecting patterns this way, you will notice that the bar numbers also get a white outline around them. This is important and means that if you move these patterns left or right, the associated custom time signatures will also be moved with them. TODO : A mobile/desktop GIF here would be nice. Copying & instancing patterns Patterns have an associated 3-digit numbers. This number is unique for a given track and allows you to tell if a pattern is used multiple times inside a track. Re-using a pattern multiple times in a track is called instancing . When modifying a pattern, all of the its instances will be modified at the same time. Another way to tell if a pattern is an instance of another is simply to select it and to look for the chain link icon . When a pattern is selected, all of its instances will show this icon and the 3-digit numbers will appear white. In the example below, pattern 000 is selected and a few other instance are shown. To create an instance of an existing pattern, simply selected it and drag from the little Colored Chain-Link Button that appears at the bottom left and release where you want to create the instance. Note that trying to create an instance on a different track will force a copy. To create a completely separate copy of a pattern, a copy that will retain no connection to the original, simply drag from the Colored Paperstack Icon that appears and release it where you want to create the copy. TODO : A mobile/desktop GIF here would be nice. De-instancing patterns If you have created instances of a pattern, but have second thoughts and want to make a unique copy, you can simply right-click on a pattern (long-press on mobile) and select the Make Pattern(s) Unique option. This will create a completely independent copy of it which its own unique 3-digit number. Merging identical patterns On the flip side, if you have created many copies of a pattern and did not end up making any unique changes to them, you can select a few patterns, right click (long-press on mobile) on the selected pattern(s) and choose the Merge Identical Patterns option. This will look for perfectly identical pattern and create instances if matches are found. Setting the loop point Each song can have a loop point which is where the song will jump to when the end is reached. Currently this is quite primitive and the song will loop forever. To set the loop point to a specific bar, simply right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number in the timeline and choose the Set Loop Point option. To clear the loop point and create a non-looping song, right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number of the currently set loop point and choose the Clear Loop Point option. Custom time signatures Songs have a default time signature, which is usually the time signature that covers most of the song. But for each bar of the song, a Custom Time Signature can be specified. To set a custom time signature for a given bar, right-click (long-press on mobile) on the bar number and select the Edit Custom Time Signature... option. If multiple bars are selected using the timeline selection mode, the changes will be applied to all selected bars.

Please do note that piano roll tracks always come before automation tracks in a channel.","title":"Reordering channels &amp; tracks"},{"location":"sequencer/#patterns-bars","text":"At the center of the sequencer are all the patterns of the current song. Patterns can be as small as 1 bar, but can be much longer too. Patterns are re-usable little units of notes or automation tat you can re-use multiple times on a given track.","title":"Patterns &amp; Bars"},{"location":"sequencer/#adding-deleting-resizing-patterns","text":"Patterns are simply added by clicking in an empty space in the grid. On desktop, patterns are deleted using a double-click and they are resized by grabbing the left or right edge and resizing. On mobile a double-tap opens the pattern in the appropriate editor, either the piano roll or automation track editor. To delete a pattern on mobile, you can simply press the Delete button from the toolbar (big X icon) to delete any selected pattern(s). To help resizing on small screens, the mobile version will display big colored resize handles for the selected pattern(s), allowing you to resize it from the left or right side.","title":"Adding, Deleting &amp; Resizing patterns"},{"location":"sequencer/#selecting-patterns","text":"Selected patterns have a white outline around them and can be moved and resized as a group. On desktop, you can select patterns by right-clicking anywhere in the grid and dragging to drag a rectangle. On mobile, you can longpress somewhere and start drawing a rectangle once the pulsating circle appears. You can also select entire columns of patterns by doing a selection from the timeline, which is the row with the bar numbers at the top. When selecting patterns this way, you will notice that the bar numbers also get a white outline around them. This is important and means that if you move these patterns left or right, the associated custom time signatures will also be moved with them. TODO : A mobile/desktop GIF here would be nice.","title":"Selecting patterns"},{"location":"sequencer/#copying-instancing-patterns","text":"Patterns have an associated 3-digit numbers. This number is unique for a given track and allows you to tell if a pattern is used multiple times inside a track. Re-using a pattern multiple times in a track is called instancing . When modifying a pattern, all of the its instances will be modified at the same time. Another way to tell if a pattern is an instance of another is simply to select it and to look for the chain link icon . When a pattern is selected, all of its instances will show this icon and the 3-digit numbers will appear white. In the example below, pattern 000 is selected and a few other instance are shown. To create an instance of an existing pattern, simply selected it and drag from the little Colored Chain-Link Button that appears at the bottom left and release where you want to create the instance. Note that trying to create an instance on a different track will force a copy. To create a completely separate copy of a pattern, a copy that will retain no connection to the original, simply drag from the Colored Paperstack Icon that appears and release it where you want to create the copy.

Currently this is quite primitive and the song will loop forever.
